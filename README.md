# SeashellComp

This package computes the scattering resonances of a Helmholtz resonator of arbitrary shape (the "sound of the sea in a seashell") given by a triangulated 2D domain based on a method developed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02956.

A pre-defined triangulation for a circular resonator (constructed using the [distmesh](https://github.com/ionhandshaker/distmesh) package) is contained in the folder to make the code executable out-of-the-box. The code works for resonators of arbitrary geometry, provided an appropriate triangulation of the domain is given.  
The Finite Element code used in this package is partially adapted from *[Bartels S. Numerical approximation of partial differential equations. Springer; 2016]*
